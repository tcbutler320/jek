# welcome to jek

jek is a jekyll theme aimed at putting the power of color schemes into the hands of users and developers. this theme attempts to solve the problem of complicated and difficult to change color schemes for most jekyll themes. with jek, you can add a theme in as little as 2 steps, and allow your users to decide which one is best for them.  

### 👩‍🚀 add new themes

1) add a new scheme to main.css with a `background-color` and `color`.  

```
.mytheme {
    background-color: #0a1d37;
    color: #ffeedb;
}
```  

2) Add color scheme name to _data/themes.yaml  

```yaml
- name: mytheme
  enabled: true
```
